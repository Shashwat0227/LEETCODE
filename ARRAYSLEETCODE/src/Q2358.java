    //    You are given a positive integer array grades which represents the grades of students in a university.
//    You would like to enter all these students into a competition in ordered non-empty groups,
//    such that the ordering meets the following conditions:
//
//    The sum of the grades of students in the ith group is less than the sum of the grades of students in the (i + 1)th group,
//    for all groups (except the last).
//    The total number of students in the ith group is less than the total number of students in the (i + 1)th group,
//    for all groups (except the last).
//    Return the maximum number of groups that can be formed.
